# Java Client-Server TCP communication
In the Repository I made an example, where we have a 2D space (1000 x 1000) and 2 sensors and one randomly put target on that space. the flow of the program is as the following:

![The Flowchart](Sensor-Target.jpg)

You can compile each script by running:

        javac file.java

And then execute it by running:

        java file

Start the program by running the server first, then the sensors 1 and 2, and then the target.

The following screenshot is the output of the files:
